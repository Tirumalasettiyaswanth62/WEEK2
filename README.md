VSDBabySoC WEEK2 ASSIGNMENT
Overview:
BabySoC is a simplified, open-source SoC built around the RVMYTH processor core, a RISC-V-based CPU. It integrates a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for precise clock generation and a 10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) for interfacing with external analog systems. While the DAC allows BabySoC to interact with devices such as televisions or mobile phones by converting digital signals to analog, this task emphasizes understanding the internal digital behavior through simulation.
